### Features left to implement

- Multiplayer feature
  - One thing to implement is another user-input to play against your friends. Instead of using buttons, the users could use keyboard input to choose one of the options so they can't see each others choices.

## Testing

- I tested playing this game in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera
- I confirmed that the game results are always correct
- I confirmed that the header, game info, player info, results and how to play section are readable and easy to understand
- I confirmed that the colors and fonts that are chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthoise in devtools
